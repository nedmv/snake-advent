# Overview

This repository contains my solutions for year 2024 [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzles written in Python.

These are fast-to-write solutions with minimal editing (refactor a bit, but do not change the general approach).

However, the algorithm was changed if my first solution was not general (which is the case for part 2 of days 14, 17 and 24).

# Execution

1. Go to the folder `puzzles/{YEAR}/{DAY}` (e.g. `puzzles/2024/08`).
2. Create file named `input` with your puzzle input for this day.
3. Launch the script with solution: `python3 {DAY}.py`. For some unoptimized solutions execution may take a while.
4. The script will output two strings with answers for first and second parts of the puzzle.
