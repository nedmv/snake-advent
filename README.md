# Overview

This repository contains my solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzles written in Python.

These are fast-to-write solutions with minimal editing (refactor a bit, but preferably do not change the general approach).

# Solved puzzles

- Year 2024: all
- Year 2025: all

# Execution

1. Go to the folder `puzzles/{YEAR}/{DAY}` (e.g. `puzzles/2024/08`).
2. Create file named `input` with your puzzle input for this day.
3. Launch the script with solution: `python3 {DAY}.py input`. For some solutions execution may take a while.
4. The script will output two strings with answers for first and second parts of the puzzle.
